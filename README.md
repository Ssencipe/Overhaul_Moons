# Overhaul Moons

Overhaul Moons is a moon mod that will contain multiple moons in one package.

It currently adds 1 moon: Mycordytum. 

# Mycordytum

Bio: Mycordytum is a moon covered in a giant colony of interconnected advanced mushroom species and other fungi. The colony is capable of developing perfect ecosystems to help cultivate itself into a dominant species with unique mushrooms that perform specific tasks for the colony. Explore the strange moon, but be sure to escape before the fungi decide to not let you leave alive... More information on the moon can be found in the wiki tab.

Fauna: The surface of the moon is inhabited by various bugs, avian-like life, canids, reptiles, and a rare instances of mystical or mysterious entities.

Climate: The moon may experience eclipses, harsh storms, or large scale dispersal of spore clouds.

Mycordytum is currently being polished and balanced over time, but it is currently a free moon with scrap values and difficulty slightly higher than March.

This mod is still being worked on, so the visuals will be subject to change and improvement.
