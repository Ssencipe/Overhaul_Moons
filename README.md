# Overhaul Moons

Overhaul Moons is a moon mod that contains multiple moons made by me in one package.

It currently adds 2 moons: Mycordytum and Terminus.

# Mycordytum

Bio: Mycordytum is a moon covered in a giant colony of interconnected advanced mushroom species and other fungi. The colony is capable of developing perfect ecosystems to help cultivate itself into a dominant species with unique mushrooms that perform specific tasks for the colony. Explore the strange moon, but be sure to escape before the fungi decide to not let you leave alive... More information on the moon can be found in the wiki tab.

Fauna: The surface of the moon is inhabited by various bugs, avian-like life, canids, reptiles, and a rare instances of mystical or mysterious entities.

Climate: The moon may experience eclipses, harsh storms, or large scale dispersal of spore clouds.

Mycordytum is currently a free moon with scrap values and difficulty slightly higher than March. The primary interior is factory with a 1/3 chance of being mansion.

# Terminus

Bio: Mycordytum is a moon filled with paranormal activity. The dead wander freely on this planet, their spirits untethered from the world. However, their tombs have left behind numerous riches.

Fauna: Aside from the ghosts and ghouls, scavengers ranging from arachnids to canids to even large worms populate the moon. There are also other unknown man-eating entities about.

Climate: The moon may experience eclipses, storms, and heavy fog.

Terminus currently is in the process of being balanced and polished. It is intended to be close to Rend in difficulty and profit but experiences may vary. The primary interior is mansion with a rare chance of being factory.
