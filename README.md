This mod currently adds the moon Mycordytum, which is a fungal moon with a colony of mushrooms residing across its surface. It is still being developed and polished, so anything seen is not finalized. As such, I am currently not posting screenshots as they will definitely be outdated by the next update. This mod has a thread in the Lethal Company Modding Discord [Overhaul Moons (Mycordytum)].
