This is currently still just a beta build. Will update and add more details as I get more feedback, but until then screenshots, map details, and similar information will not yet be included as it is subject to change. This mod currently contains Mycordytum, a mushroom themed map. There is a thread in the Lethal Company Modding Discord dedicated to discussing the moon and feedback.
