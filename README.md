### Overhaul Moons

Overhaul Moons is a mood mod that will contain multiple moons in one package.

It currently adds just 1 moon: Mycordytum. 

# Mycordytum

Mycordytum is a moon covered in a giant colony of interconnected advanced mushroom species and other fungi. The colony is capable of developing perfect ecosystems to help cultivate itself into a dominant species with unique mushrooms that perform specific tasks for the colony. Explore the strange moon, but be sure to escape before the fungi decide to not let you leave alive...

More specific lore details will be fleshed out in the wiki tab over time.

Mycordytum is currently being polished and balanced over time, but it is currently a free moon with scrap values and difficulty slightly higher than March.

This mod is still being worked on, so the visuals will be updated and polished over time.
